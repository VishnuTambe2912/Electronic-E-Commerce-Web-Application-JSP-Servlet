        <h3>Customer Support</h3>
        <p>
          Digital natives consider technology an integral part of their lives. When they want to solve a problem, get an answer, or purchase something, they turn to their devices to get instant gratification.

          As a result, online shopping is growing at breakneck speed. In 2019, there were 263 million digital buyers in the United States. This figure is projected to grow to 282.7 million online buyers by 2024.

          That said, there’s no longer a product or category that doesn’t belong online, and online marketplaces are witnessing record-breaking numbers. For example, every month, over 206 million people around the world visit Amazon.

          All these numbers illustrate how the battle for consumer attention has moved online. The question is, what can businesses do to be more competitive?

          The short answer is ecommerce customer service.
